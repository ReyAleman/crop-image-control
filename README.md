# crop-image-control
C# windows forms user control to create a rubber band style image cropping tool. Drag your mouse over an image to draw a rectangle on the photo. The rectangle can be moved and/or resized with the mouse. A method on the control returns the portion of the image enclosed by the cropping rectangle as a .NET Image object. A demonstration project is included in the Visual Studio solution. 

# Environment
Visual Studio 2013, .NET Framework 4.5, but could use earlier .NET version.
